# SD5913 — Programming for Artists and Designers

PolyU School of Design · 2026

This repository holds the weekly material for SD5913. It is built as the semester
runs, so expect it to grow week by week — `git pull` before each class.

---

## Start here

1. **Register your GitHub account** against your student ID:
   **<https://pfad.ait4x.org>**. One minute. This is how your work gets matched
   to you, and it is how you get invited to the
   [`sd5913`](https://github.com/sd5913) organisation.
2. **Work through [`week01/README.md`](week01/README.md).** It takes you from
   "no GitHub account" to "my first repository is published".
3. **Read [`assignments/01-why-are-we-here.md`](assignments/01-why-are-we-here.md).**
   Your first assignment is due at the end of week 2. Before you submit, run
   [the check](assignments/check.py) inside your repo — it tells you what is missing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sd5913/pfad
cd pfad
```

## This repo has two branches, and that is on purpose

```
2026   ← you are here. This year's course. The default branch.
2025   ← last year's complete course. Frozen, kept for reference.
```

Branches are parallel versions of the same repository. They share a name and a
remote, but their contents are independent — you move between them and the files
on disk change under you.

Have a look right now:

```bash
git branch -a          # every branch this clone knows about
git switch 2025        # last year's course, all 13 weeks of it
ls                     # different files entirely
git switch 2026        # back to the present
```

Last year's material is genuinely useful — it is a complete, working course, and
several of this year's assignments have a 2025 ancestor worth reading. It is just
not *this* year's material, so it lives out of the way on its own branch instead
of cluttering the folder you work in.

You will use branches for real later, when your group project has three people
changing code at once and you need to work without standing on each other. For
now, know that they exist and that switching between them is free.

> The 2025 edition also still lives at
> [`venetanji/pfad`](https://github.com/venetanji/pfad) if you would rather browse
> it as its own repository.

## Assignments

| # | What | Weight | Due |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Why are we here?](assignments/01-why-are-we-here.md) — a reflection, published as a repository | 5% | Sun 13 Sep 2026, 23:59 |
| 2 | Data visualisation project | 10% | week 5 |
| 3 | Interactive experience project | 15% | TBC |

Plus participation (10%), a mid-term quiz (10%), the group project (40%), and a
final quiz (10%).

**Everything you submit in this course is a portfolio piece.** Your repositories
are public, your commits carry your name, and they accumulate into something you
can show people. Treat them accordingly.

## Weekly content

| Week | Topic |
|---|---|
| 01 | [Git, GitHub, and your first repository](week01/README.md) |
| 02 | [Your repo passes the check · predict, break, fix](week02/README.md) |

More lands each week.
